# Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
* communication is the key here. Will talk about it and ultimately refer back to the constructor. 
* Positive encouragement is also vital, but I believe we are all here to learn. 

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
Only when a team member is refusing to communicate. Other than that, things are manageable. 
# Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Slack channel is always open for everyone to share ideas. A zoom meeting can be held if needed. Phonecalls is also an option.
### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
Conformation from all team members and delegating tasks to every team member. 
### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
All members are good communicators. We have no problem sharing ideas. Everyone is supportive and open to new ideas or suggestions . 
# Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.


### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
* On Trello , we are planning to add every task that we will work on along with the name of the member working on it. Will assign tasks based on preference or competency.

Trello.

# Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

### How will you share the repository with your teammates?
* All members are owners of the organization so they can have access to repos. 
### What is your Git flow?
* Each member has to add the feature on a branch of their own name. and the feature name. 
* ACP from one member and merge on staging. Then. An hour to be decided later on a daily baisis.
	
### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
### How many people must review a PR?
* 3 people to manage the PR request. 
### Who merges PRs?
* Any member of the the 3 people merging.
